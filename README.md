# SiteTracker
A lot of my teacher have websites, but often fail to mention when they've updated the homework, added notes, posted an announcement, etc. This site aims to fix that by emailing you whenever a site is updated.

This project should currently only be considered in alpha, as I've neglected all but the essential bits at this point. Features I'd like to include in the future:
- CSS on the page
- Specific diffs included in email body
- ability to delete, modify entries
